# Charter Profit Intelligence Engine

A financial modeling system built to calculate true trip profitability in small fishing charter operations.

## Problem

Most charter operators know what they charge.
Few know what they actually keep.

Fuel volatility, maintenance wear, bait costs, and fixed overhead quietly erode margins.

## Solution

This engine calculates:

- Fuel cost per trip
- Maintenance reserve allocation
- True total trip cost
- Net profit
- Profit margin percentage
- Break-even pricing

## Why It Matters

Without accurate cost modeling:

- Pricing decisions are guesswork
- Margins shrink silently
- Peak demand may still be underpriced
- Cash flow becomes unstable

This system provides financial clarity for operational control.
